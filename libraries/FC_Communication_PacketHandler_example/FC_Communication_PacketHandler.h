/*
	HOW TO USE:
	- In the class use data structure to access the data. This should be the only place, where whole
	  sent and received data are stored.
	- Outside the class use toSend and received public references to the data (data to send place
	  in toSend structure reference before sending, in the received structure reference)
	- All variables to send have to be created in toSendDataType and only there.
	- All variables to receive have to be created in receivedDataType and only there.
